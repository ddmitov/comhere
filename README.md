comhere
=======

ComHere invokes Windows Command Prompt in the current directory.<br>
I made this little utility back in 2008 for my external harddrive so I could start programs with command line arguments from their folders without changing directories with 'cd' command, which is tedious when you have many folders and long paths.<br>
It is coded using Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) and has no additional dependencies.
